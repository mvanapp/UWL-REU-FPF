Ordination: summarizes multidimensional data by plotting similar species and samples close together in low-dimensional ordination space

- Useful for visualizing cluster solutions 


Goal for nMDS plot, from https://jonlefcheck.net/ 
========================================================

Other Ordination Methods
========================================================
Alternate Methods: Principal components analysis (PCA), Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) (graphic from https://ourcodingclub.github.io/)

- Analytical approaches: single unique solutions 
- Use techniques based on eigenvalues and eigenvectors 
- Assume linear or model relationships within data 


nMDS  
========================================================
- Numerical, iterative approach: no unique solution

  - Stops when acceptable solution is obtained or after set number of attempts 

- More configuration options

- Fewer assumptions 


Drawbacks:

- Slow 
- sometimes finds local minimum instead of best solution 

Computation: nMDS process 
========================================================
- Calculates a distance matrix from an original matrix of samples and variables 
- Chooses m dimensions for ordination
- nMDS software begins with initial configuration of samples in those m dimensions
- Calculates distances among samples
- Regresses distances against original distance matrix
- Calculates predicted ordination distances for each pair of samples



Computation: quality of fit
========================================================
- Sum of squared differences between ordination-based distances and distances predicted by regression
- Kruskalâ€™s stress equation
  - D_hi: ordinated distance between samples h and i 
	- D-hat: distance predicted from regression

Computation: fit improvement 
========================================================
- Slightly alters positions of samples based on stress value 
- Recalculates ordination distance matrix and stress value
- Repeats until procedure converges or for set number of iterations 

Considerations  
========================================================

Concern: too many or too few dimensions

Solution: Scree Diagram 

nMDS on Willow, maximum number of iterations = 500
