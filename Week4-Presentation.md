Our Current Objective
========================================================
left: 70%

To construct a hierarchical classification of UMRS forest types that are...
- Ecologically unique
- Useful to foresters
- Suitable for scientific research

<b>Last week</b>, we completed Level 1 using simple rules-based classification and examined various clustering algorithms.

<b>This week</b>, we construct a function for Level 2 classification and visualize results.

Exploration of Ward's Clustering Method
========================================================

How can we define these clusters in a simpler manner?

How can we select the correct number of clusters to use in our definition?

How can we ensure our clusters are ecologically significant?

Ward's Method with Three Clusters, Silver Maple



Simplifying Clusters: Rule Extraction
========================================================
De Caceres et al (2019) recommends supervised learning for assignment rules to define clusters.

<b>Decision Trees</b> can extract rules to define clusters in a simpler manner
- Input clusters as labels for training data
- Partitions feature space based on simple logic-based rules (greater than or less than)
- Can inform on the number of clusters to use by comparing to clustering


Decision Tree versus Ward's Method
========================================================

Finding the Correct Number of Clusters
========================================================
Take decision tree classification most similar to  Ward clustering, determined by v-measure

V-measure takes into account homogeneity and completeness (entropy-based)

Further Issues to Investigate in Dominant Plots
========================================================
Imbalanced Class Problem
- Some clusters may have few plots but are ecologically significant
- Potential Solution: oversample classes such that they have the same number of observations as largest class
  - Issue: can result in poor performance, as in Green Ash and Willow clusterings
  
Further Issues to Investigate in Dominant Plots
========================================================
Ecological Significance
- How can we determine if clusters are too similar?
- Potential Solution: "Multi Response Permutation Procedure" or "Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance"    
  - Tests for significant differences between clusters
  - How can we pick out which clusters to merge?

Minimum bin size has large impact on decision tree solution




Mixed Plots
========================================================



- Summary information:
 - 8225 mixed plots 
 - 43.39% of plots
 
- Plots can have significant variation in size and species distributions

- Provides a challenge in clustering plots
  - Which differences are ecologically important?


First steps
===========
left: 50%

- Use CAP values for hierarchical clustering on the mixed plots

- Cut dendrogram, examine cluster composition

  - Species composition and the size structures within clusters

The Lone Plot 
====
left: 40% 


- Plot `TDB` is lone cluster at k = 3

- Silver maple prominent in both clusters 1 and 2

- `TBD` has higher amounts of snags and sycamores than the two clusters
  - As well as swamp privet

Taking more clusters
======

***
- Must determine # of clusters while retaining ecological relevance
- Examine species and size distributions
- 8 and 9, 1 and 6 similar in structure
- Must quantify differences between clusters
  - Could potentially use CAPs of clusters


Comparing CAPs among clusters
======

Next steps for the mixed plots
======
- Determine the best clusters for these plots

- Exact methods will be discussed next week
  - Possibly multidimensional scaling
  - May need to subsample due to long run time
  
- As for dominant, decision trees can extract rules for each cluster

Ordination: summarizes multidimensional data by plotting similar species and samples close together in low-dimensional ordination space

- Useful for visualizing cluster solutions 


Goal for nMDS plot, from https://jonlefcheck.net/ 
========================================================
<img src="week_4_pres_images/plot_example.png" width=50% height=50%>



Other Ordination Methods
========================================================
Alternate Methods: Principal components analysis (PCA), Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) (graphic from https://ourcodingclub.github.io/)

<img src="week_4_pres_images/pcoa.png" width=100% height=50%>

***

- Analytical approaches: single unique solutions 
- Use techniques based on eigenvalues and eigenvectors 
- Assume linear or model relationships within data 


nMDS  
========================================================
- Numerical, iterative approach: no unique solution

  - Stops when acceptable solution is obtained or after set number of attempts 

- More configuration options

- Fewer assumptions 


Drawbacks:

- Slow 
- sometimes finds local minimum instead of best solution 

Computation: nMDS process 
========================================================
- Calculates a distance matrix from an original matrix of samples and variables 
- Chooses m dimensions for ordination
- nMDS software begins with initial configuration of samples in those m dimensions
- Calculates distances among samples
- Regresses distances against original distance matrix
- Calculates predicted ordination distances for each pair of samples



Computation: quality of fit
========================================================
- Sum of squared differences between ordination-based distances and distances predicted by regression
- Kruskalâ€™s stress equation
  - D_hi: ordinated distance between samples h and i 
	- D-hat: distance predicted from regression
	
<img src="week_4_pres_images/stress_equation.png" width=100% height=75%>


Computation: fit improvement 
========================================================
- Slightly alters positions of samples based on stress value 
- Recalculates ordination distance matrix and stress value
- Repeats until procedure converges or for set number of iterations 

Considerations  
========================================================

Concern: too many or too few dimensions

Solution: Scree Diagram 

nMDS on Willow, maximum number of iterations = 500
